A simple clock website that displays the time of different countries.
It also has a stopwatch.
=======
Languages used: HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
To use:
1) Clone the repository to your device
2) open the folder clock-website in VS Code
3) open the clock.html and run it through the live server. [You need to install a live server add-on on VS code]

I will try to deploy it in the future. Feel free to send me pull requests; let's learn together. ðŸ˜Š
